# Predict the next likely word using the Kaze Backoff algorithm

This repo hosts the Shiny App code (ui.R and server.R) for the final project of the Data Science Specialization Capstone. Click [here](http://www.rpubs.com/adsgs/KBO1) for the overview, data source/wrangling, and the algorithm implementation details. 
There is a lot to be desired in the prediction ability of [the Shiny App](www.suzow.us/KBO1).  Nonetheless, this is the first [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing) project with which I gained strong interests in the facinating field.  As much as I cherish the ugly pinch pots that I made during the first ceramic class, I have a special place in my heart for this project.
